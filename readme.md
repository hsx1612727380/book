# book

A sample project of book shopping cart by used JSP/Servlet.

### function:

- book list
- cartItem list
- buy book[add book]
- delete cartItem
- clear all cartItems

### disadvantage:

- in the listCart.jsp, just buy books will add 1 when every refresh. I think I don't control the sessionScope.
